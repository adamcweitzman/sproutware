## Founder & Full-Stack Developer | Angular, .NET, Azure Microservices | Hostbookz

Hostbookz was my own creation a platform built from the ground up using Angular on the front end, .NET on the back end, and Azure microservices humming beneath it all like a well-tuned zither.

The goal? To make hosting and managing properties as smooth as a warm cup of tea on a rainy day. I designed the entire system—from booking flows to user authentication to admin dashboards—putting care into both the experience and the engineering.

Under the hood, I leveraged Azure Functions, App Services, and Service Bus to create a scalable, cloud-native solution that could grow without losing its soul. I handled everything from infrastructure-as-code to UX polish, blending modern DevOps with timeless design principles.

It was a chance to wear all the hats—and to learn how each one fits. And like any good host, I made sure the platform always put people first.
