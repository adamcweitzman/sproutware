## Community-Driven Job Sourcing | Relationship Building | Boise Tech Jobs

At Boise Tech Jobs, I wasn’t just posting jobs—I was listening. Listening to recruiters, to developers, to hiring managers over coffee and code, trying to understand what this growing little tech ecosystem really needed.

I built real relationships with local recruiters and companies, not just to fill a site with listings, but to make sure the right opportunities found the right people. This wasn’t automation—it was care, trust, and a little hustle.

I also collaborated with the local tech community—attending meetups, sponsoring events, and making sure the platform reflected what Boise’s developers were really looking for, not just what was easy to scrape from the internet.

It was grassroots tech work: a little scrappy, a little heartfelt, and deeply rewarding.
