## AI-Powered Document Search | Azure Cognitive Services | Marathon Petroleum

At Marathon Petroleum, I built a smarter way to find what people were looking for—because no one likes digging through endless folders to find that one PDF from 2019.

Using Azure AI and Cognitive Search, I designed and developed a new intelligent search experience for internal documents. This involved natural language processing, smart indexing, and a sprinkle of machine learning magic to make the whole thing actually useful.

I worked closely with the people using it—from engineers to administrators—to make sure it wasn't just technically impressive, but also genuinely helpful. The result? A search tool that feels more like talking to a helpful coworker and less like yelling into a void.
