## Cross-Platform Mobile Development | Ionic + Native Kotlin/iOS | DevonWay

At DevonWay, I helped craft a work task management app that kept people organized, efficient, and a little less buried in chaos. Built in Ionic, but with native iOS and Android features where it counted, the app was designed to be both flexible and fast.

I dove deep into both sides of mobile—using Kotlin for Android-specific needs and Swift/Objective-C for iOS, stitching everything together to feel seamless no matter the device. Think of it like blending Eastern and Western martial arts into one elegant form.

The app empowered teams in the field—whether they were tracking safety tasks, inspections, or operational checklists. It needed to be intuitive, resilient, and responsive even in environments where connectivity was as elusive as a panda in a snowstorm.

Working closely with designers, testers, and stakeholders, I made sure the tech served the people using it—not the other way around.
