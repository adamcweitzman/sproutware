## Legacy API Modernization | Azure API Management (APM) | Umpqua Bank

At Umpqua Bank, I took some very old, very cranky APIs and gave them a second life—like teaching a stubborn old badger to dance again, but with cloud technology.

Using Azure API Management (APM), I wrapped legacy systems in sleek, secure, and scalable interfaces without disrupting the underlying logic. Think of it as building new plumbing over ancient stonework—clean, efficient, and much less leaky.

The work wasn’t just technical—it was also diplomatic. I collaborated with teams across infrastructure, security, and business operations to make sure our modern solutions still respected the old rhythms of the bank's core systems.

In the end, we didn’t just upgrade technology—we made it easier for the next generation of builders to work with the tools of the past.
