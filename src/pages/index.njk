      <p>
        At Sproutware Consulting, I bring over a decade of experience as a software engineer with roots in both the tech industry and education (I used to be a science teacher!)<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve built and managed complex legacy systems for Fortune 500 companies including <mark>Alaska Air Group, Marathon Petroleum, and Columbia Bank.</mark> I've also started from just the seed of an idea at fledgling startups like <mark>Tripchamp, Sync1Systems and Q2.</mark> I use the same philosophy everytime: relationships and understanding first, then code.
      </p>
      <p> 
        With deep knowledge in the Microsoft stack, Azure cloud architecture, and modern front-end frameworks like Angular and React, I provide bespoke software solutions that balance innovation with stability. 
        Whether it's streamlining operations, crafting elegant user experiences, or integrating cutting-edge AI, my goal is always to help businesses flourish.
